            ¡Hi! I'm Katherine. <br><br> I welcome you to my virtual corner...... 
            Here I share a selection of photos that I have captured during my exciting trips to various cities around the world.<br>
            <br> If I had to summarize my life in a few words, I would say that every day I value the wonderful experience of existing.
            Sharing every moment with my family, my husband and my adorable dog "Alma" fills me with joy.
            Every day I strive to be a better version of myself, seeking happiness and spreading it to those around me. <br>
            My passion for photography arose when I began to explore different countries and came across contrasting landscapes.
            with the beauty of my beloved Bogotá. This experience motivated me to purchase a camera before my next trip, 
            determined to capture the memories that my eyes treasured. <br>
            If any of the images in this blog captivate you, do not hesitate to contact me to share your impressions.
            I hope that, like me, you find something that inspires you to try something new, that awakens your curiosity.
            Just like I did with photography!
